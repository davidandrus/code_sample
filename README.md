# HasOffers Front-End Coding Challenge

I completed this challenge when I first started working for Tune (formerly HasOffers). The intention of the challenge was to get more acquainted with angular, which is what the app that I was working on at the time was written in.

## Installation

``` sh
npm install -g yo
npm install
bower install
```

## Running The App
``` sh
grunt server
```
